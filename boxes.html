        The internet was conceived by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. government in 1969. ARPA was later renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1972. DARPA's first known packet-switching network was known as the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). The original goal was to create a network that would let users of a research computer at one university talk to research computers at other universities. A side benefit of ARPANET's design was that because messages could be routed or rerouted in more than one direction, the network could continue to function even if parts of it were destroyed in the event of a military attack or other disaster.
